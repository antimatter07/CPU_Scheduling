# How to run

1. Before running the main.py file, change the `filename` variable in `line 369` into the .csv or .txt file with the input data.
```python
369 |  filename = "input.txt"

```
  Alternatively, you can replace the text in the provided `input.txt` with your own input data. <br />
  **Note:** The program assumes that there is only one standard input in the file.
  
2. In your command prompt, go to the directory where `main.py` is located. Then, run the following:
```
python main.py
```
